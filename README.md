# Project 1 - College Recruitment Improvement Study
 The Computer Science department at the County College of Morris (CCM) runs surveys at the end of a semester for students taking CMP that are NOT enrolled in a CMP major. The results of these surveys are used for recruitment initiatives.  

### Purpose 
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate simple data import, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data transformation, data cleaning and data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. We will answer 4 basic questions as a result of this study:
1. What are the changes over time (2020-24) in age demographics?  
2. What non-CMP degree/programs have the highest occurrences of respondents taking a Computer Literacy Course? Conversely, what are the least?  
3. What are the most effective information sources for non-CMP respondents seeking additional Computer Science courses? Conversely, what are the least?  
4. What interests are survey respondents seeking the most? Conversely, what are the least? 

### Code
The code is contained in the 'survey.ipynb' file and is intended to by run in JupyterLab environment. The code includes all activities from data import, through EDA, data transformation, cleaning and analysis. The code also includes observations and conclusions as markdown blocks in the notebook file. Please note that executing the code will generate files in this directory. These files are intended for off-line analysis and viewing at certain points in the code. 

### Input Files (Raw Data)
The raw data files used in this analysis are included, and must be located in the same directory as the code above.
